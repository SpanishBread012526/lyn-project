    Dear Allyna,  
    <br><br>
This day will always be special, because itâ€™s the day you came into this world. And even if things didnâ€™t turn out the way I once hoped, Iâ€™m still grateful youâ€™re hereâ€”living, breathing, enojoying life.<br>

Everything might feel unfortunate for me, but what matters most is that things work out best for you. Thatâ€™s enough.<br>

I hope life gives you more peace, more love, more reasons to smile. You deserve a gentle and happy life. 
    <br><br>
    Happy 14th, lyn. May this year and every year ahead be kind to you.  
    <br><br>
    â€” Gabby

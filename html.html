                    I made this. And it's not that I want you back this instance—I know din naman na there's no chance since you already like someone. Plus, I want you to live your life without the likes of me bothering you, lol. I made this and it sounds like a small confession. Don't misunderstand me, okay? Life isn't just all about love. The way I wait for you might look like love is all I do lol ToT. That's why I’m just letting things go the way they are right now amidst the chaos of waiting for nothing:| I just want to make you something cool, which is making something using coding.

                <p>Before you read this, jwlyk that these are filled with my feelings, emotions, basta everything. This is literally a genuine thing I made. At first, I decided to make you 21 letters because your birthday is on the 21st, but I don’t think I can make it because there's so much work in school :( So I'll just put it all in one site—you can just take this as a joke, btw. It doesn't matter how you claim me as. I just want to make this because I think it would be nice and cool. Did I mention to take this as a joke? lol. I've been planning to make this since the last time you visited SINHS.</p>

                    <h2>September 6, 2025</h2>
                    <p>Boi,</p>
                    <p>Congrats on making it to the honor list!! You don’t know how happy I am right now—my heart feels lighter seeing you achieve something like this. I feel honored knowing na honor ka :). You’ve accomplished something big nanaman, and I’m truly, genuinely proud of you. You’ve always been such a determined, hardworking person, and I can see how much effort you put into everything you do. You deserve this recognition, every bit of it :). </p>
                    <p>Even though I didn’t quite make it myself, I was so close, but that doesn’t change the fact that I’m so proud of you. Even if I didn’t reach that 90 average to be on the honor list, just knowing that you’re there makes me feel honored too. Because you, dear, inspire me to do better every day. You’ve taught me how to fight for what I want, how to keep pushing even when I’m tired. You’ve shown me what determination really looks like, and that’s a lesson I’ll carry with me forever.</p>
                    <p>You always give your 100 percent—no hesitation, no holding back—and that’s something I admire so deeply. I hope you know how much of an impact you’ve had on me :), how much I’ve grown because of you. Honestly, I’d still be just as happy for you no matter what achievements you get, big or small. Seeing you thrive and succeed already fills me with happiness.</p>
                    <p>Keep going, boi. Keep chasing your dreams and doing your best. I’ll always be rooting for you from wherever I stand.</p>
                    <p>I hope you’ll never forget that no matter where life takes us, I will never forget you. You’re not just someone I love—no, you’re a part of me. You’ve made me into who I am; I can’t imagine life without your presence back then, your laughter, your warmth. You’re in the way I see the world now.</p>
                    <p>Every memory we’ve made together, I hold close, like treasures I’ll never let go of. They’re stored deep inside me—your smile, your voice, the way you brighten even the bluest days. Even if years pass and things change, you’ll always be that person who left a mark on me that no one else can erase, lol.</p>
                    <p>I hope you feel loved beyond measure, because you deserve that and so much more. You’ve touched my life in ways I can’t even fully explain, and maybe you've changed the lives of those around you. I want to thank you for existing, for being who you are, for letting me love you dati.</p>
                    <p>No matter what, I’ll carry you with me through every step of my life, and I don’t care if it seems silly. Always.</p>

                    <h2>September 1, 2025</h2>
                    <p>Lyn,</p>
                    <p>It’s the 1st of September, a new month, and I just wanted to start it by telling you something important: you matter more than someone could ever put into words. Even on your worst days, even in those moments when you feel like you’re not enough, please know you’re more than enough. You’re someone whose presence is so deeply rooted in someone's life that no one can imagine a world without you.</p>
                    <p>You are loved, Lyn. More than you realize. Even when you can’t see it, even when you doubt yourself, you’re someone’s safe space (your cof), someone’s home. I couldn’t forget you even if I tried—your soul has become a part of me, and I’ll always carry you inside my heart. You’re unforgettable, irreplaceable, and I want you to always remember that, even if you're already holding someone’s arms wholeheartedly.</p>
                    <p>So as September begins, I hope you hold your head high. I hope you keep being yourself, exactly as you are, because you are everything someone could ever ask for. Never change, dud. You’re perfect the way you are, and that's what you've told me—"we are perfect just the way we are."</p>
                    <p>Every night before I fall asleep, I pray for you. I pray for your happiness, for your safety, for your family, and for your peace of mind. I pray that every day brings you a little more light, that you’ll find comfort even on hard days. I pray for your dreams, that you’ll see them all come true one day, and yes, I pray for you to be on that honor list, because I know how much it means to you.</p>
                    <p>But more than that, I pray for your heart. I pray that you always feel loved, that you never feel alone, because you are so deeply loved, Lyn. You’ve become a part of my existence—a piece of my soul I could never let go of, even if I wanted to. And just so you know, I’ll never stop caring for you. I’ll never let go of you, no matter where life takes us.</p>
                    <p>You’re one of the greatest blessings God has ever given me—a Christmas gift from December 2024, perhaps. You’re the reason I wake up and try again every day. I hope that wherever you are, you feel the love that God wants you to feel, even in silence.</p>
                    <p>Forever, you’ll be my prayer.</p>
